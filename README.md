# Tinyland
A very small version of Dynamicland. [For more...](https://www.notion.so/Tinyland-f05733c9b73141c181352f5b5012ce1a)

## Setup
Use `pip3 install` to install the libraries in `pyland.py`.

Set values in "projector.toml" as needed. 

To develop offline, set these two:
```
USE_CAMERA = false 
VIDEO_FILE_PATH = "/path/to/a/video/of/the/table.m4v"
``` 

Where can I get some of these test videos? [Right here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qy7gj1giyj1gpd3/tinyland-test-videos.zip?dl=0)

## Usage
`python3 ./tinyland.py`

Two window will open, "Tinyland" and "Tinycam". Move Tinyland to the projector. Then press "f" to make it fullscreen. (You can also resize it using the ordinary OS window controls.)

Press "q" to quit.
